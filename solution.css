One possible solution is to avoid setting `pointer-events: none` on the element and instead use another method to prevent it from responding to mouse events. For example, we can use `z-index` to layer elements.  Make sure the blurred element is behind any elements that need to receive events.  Below is an illustration. Instead of using a single element with both pointer-events and blur, use two separate elements.  One for the blurred element and one on top to receive the pointer events.

```css
/* solution.css */
.blurred-element {
  filter: blur(5px);
  /* other styles */
}

.overlay {
  /* styles for the overlay element */
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1; /* Ensures overlay is on top */
}
```
